Consumers may want to move their telephones a little closer to the TV set .
Couch jocks watching ABC 's `` Monday Night Football '' can now vote during halftime for the greatest play in 20 years from among four or five filmed replays .
Two weeks ago , viewers of several NBC daytime consumer segments started calling a 900 number for advice on various life issues .
And the new syndicated `` reality '' show `` Hard Copy '' records viewers ' opinions for possible airing on the next day 's show .
Interactive telephone technology has taken a new leap in sophistication , and television programmers are racing to exploit the possibilities .
Eventually viewers may grow bored with the technology and resent the cost .
But right now programmers are figuring that viewers who are busy dialing up a range of services may put down their remote control zappers and stay tuned .
`` We 've been spending a lot of time in Los Angeles talking to TV production people , '' says Mike Parks , president of Call Interactive , which supplied technology for both ABC Sports and NBC 's consumer minutes .
`` With the competitiveness of the television market these days , everyone is looking for a way to get viewers more excited . ''
One of the leaders behind the expanded use of 900 numbers is Call Interactive , a joint venture of giants American Express Co. and American Telephone & Telegraph Co .
Formed in August , the venture weds AT&T 's newly expanded 900 service with 200 voice computers in American Express 's Omaha , Neb. , service center .
Other long carriers have also begun marketing enhanced 900 service , and special consultants are springing up to exploit the new tool .
Blair Entertainment , a New York firm that advises TV stations and sells ads for them , has just formed a subsidiary -- 900 Blair -- to apply the technology to television .
The use of 900 toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in recent years .
For a while , high pornography lines and services that tempt children to dial -LRB- and redial -RRB- movie or music information earned the service a somewhat sleazy image , but new legal restrictions are aimed at trimming excesses .
The cost of a 900 call is set by the originator -- ABC Sports , for example -- with the cheapest starting at 75 cents .
Billing is included in a caller 's regular phone bill .
From the fee , the local phone company and the long carrier extract their costs to carry the call , passing the rest of the money to the originator , which must cover advertising and other costs .
In recent months , the technology has become more flexible and able to handle much more volume .
Before , callers of 900 numbers would just listen and not talk , or they 'd vote `` yes '' or `` no '' by calling one of two numbers .
-LRB- People in the phone business call this technology `` 900 click . '' -RRB-
Now , callers are led through complex menus of choices to retrieve information they want , and the hardware can process 10,000 calls in 90 seconds .
Up to now , 900 numbers have mainly been used on local TV stations and cable channels .
MTV used one to give away the house that rock star Jon Bon Jovi grew up in .
For several years , Turner Broadcasting System 's Cable News Network has invited viewers to respond nightly to topical issues -LRB- `` Should the U.S. military intervene in Panama ? '' -RRB- , but even the hottest controversies on CNN log only about 10,000 calls .
The newest uses of the 900 technology demonstrate the growing variety of applications .
Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. , CBS Inc. and General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. unit are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about hunger .
The subject will be written into the plots of prime shows , and viewers will be given a 900 number to call .
Callers will be sent educational booklets , and the call 's modest cost will be an immediate method of raising money .
Other network applications have very different goals .
ABC Sports was looking for ways to lift deflated halftime ratings for `` Monday Night Football . ''
Kurt Sanger , ABC Sports 's marketing director , says that now `` tens of thousands '' of fans call its 900 number each week to vote for the best punt return , quarterback sack , etc .
Profit from the calls goes to charity , but ABC Sports also uses the calls as a sales tool : After thanking callers for voting , Frank Gifford offers a football videotape for $ 19.95 , and 5 % of callers stay on the line to order it .
Jackets may be sold next .
Meanwhile , NBC Sports recently began `` Scores Plus , '' a year , 24 900 line providing a complex array of scores , analysis and fan news .
A spokesman said its purpose is `` to bolster the impression that NBC Sports is always there for people . ''
NBC 's `` On '' consumer minutes have increased advertiser spending during the day , the network 's weakest period .
Each weekday matches a sponsor and a topic : On Mondays , Unilever N.V. 's Lever Bros. sponsors tips on diet and exercise , followed by a 30 Lever Bros. commercial .
Viewers can call a 900 number for additional advice , which will be tailored to their needs based on the numbers they punch -LRB- `` Press one if you 're pregnant , '' etc . -RRB- .
If the caller stays on the line and leaves a name and address for the sponsor , coupons and a newsletter will be mailed , and the sponsor will be able to gather a list of desirable potential customers .
