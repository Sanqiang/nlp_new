This repository contains code I wrote in the class [Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing](http://www.isi.edu/natural-language/teaching/cs562/).Hopefully this can be useful to other people who are also learning NLP techniques. The code that I wrote is licensed under WTFPL version 2.The details are described in the `report.pdf` files in each sub-folder. Here's a brief summary of what they are about:1. hw1: Restore vowels to vowelless text using Finite-State Machines2. hw2: Trigram language model with improved Kneser-Ney smoothing (*best performance in class*)3. hw3: Unsupervised part-of-speech tagging using Baumâ€“Welch Algorithm4. hw4: Part-of-speech tagging using Conditional Random Fields (*3rd best performance in class*)5. hw5: Context free grammar parsing using CKY algorithm, with vertical markovization6. final project: a modern-Chinese-to-classical-Chinese machine translation systemMost code is written in [scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) (except for hw5, which is written Python: the professor kindly provided a few hundred lines of useful code in Python and I was too lazy to reimplement them, so I just learnt the language instead). You may need [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) or [sbt script runner](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Detailed-Topics/Scripts) to execute them.
